# LCD-Ph-Meter
Here is the code for a digital Ph meter using Arduino with lcd.
To run this code copy the code on your arduino ide and connect the pins as defined in the code

Pins on for the lcd without using potentiometer - rs = 12, en = 11, d4 = 5, d5 = 4, d6 = 3, d7 = 2

Connect the po pin pn A0 - analog input

The sensor is automatically temperature caliberated. You can see a black sensor on the board which is actually the temp sensor.

Ive added a PH OFFSET CALIBRATION = 8.1 but it might vary for you so test and caliberate it accordingly

The output is printed on LCD and on Serial monitor
